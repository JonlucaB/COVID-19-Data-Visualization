# COVID-19-Data-Visualization
As a project for a class I am taking at Trinity University, I was tasked to visualize data using Processing 3. There are two visualizations: a scatter plot and a map of the counties with data mapped on top. 
Three states can be shown: Texas, Georgia, and Colorado. Election results from 2016 and 2020 were used in this project. Covid statistics were drawn from Zazzle.
