# COVID-19-Data-Visualization
<br/>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>Within this repository, click the 'application' folder and download the 'windows-amd64' folder. Once the file
has downloaded, open the folder and double click the source.exe file.</p>
<br/>
<p>Only the windows executable is available at the moment, due to file size limits on Github. If you are unable to use this executable, please reference the demo video at the bottom of this page.</p>
<span style="color:red">This app requires you to have a java run time (JRE) installed on your system. If you do not have it installed, you may download it through the </span><p>[Official JRE Website](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)</p>
<br/>
<h2>What is This?</h2>
<p>This app was developed using [Processing](https://processing.org/), an open source graphical library for Java. If you would like to read more about this library. It is great for creating unique and engaging visual displays, and even comes with an IDE that makes running a program very simple. This app was written in that IDE!</p>
<br/>
<p>The inspiration behind this project was based on current events. The team thought it interesting to combine data about the Novel Covid-19 virus and voter data from past 4 years into a nice graphical representation. We achieved this using built in tools of Processing and a little research!</p>
<p>All of the data used for this tool was provided by Zazzle. There are three states available for viewing in this app: Texas, Goergia, and Colorado. For each state, a scatter plot and a county map are available and can be toggled using space bar. Each data point has Covid, political, and population data. Each point represents a county, and in the map mode each point rests on its respective county in the map. The user can hover over the point to view its data, and click the point if they would like to keep it and its data highlighted.</p>
<p>The filters on the left side of the window are for the user to manipulate the viewable data. To switch between the two years of data, simply click the year. There are keys mapped to filter parameters in the application. For instance, pressing 'w' changes the data to Georgia. The rest of the mappings are described in the instructions by pressing 'i' on the apllication's window.</P>
